# Introduction

Last year, I moved here from Iran, leaving behind everything and everyone I once knew. It was a difficult decision—especially leaving my family—but it was a necessary step.

As a newcomer, there were several essentials needed to start a new life:
- SSID
- Phone Number
- Bank Account
- Driving License

---
# First Steps
Once I had secured these, the next phase began: **Building a new Life**
1. Find a Job
2. Enroll in College
3. Purchase a Car
4. Establish Credit
5. Find a Place to Live

---
# Motivation
I had an *excellent* job possession and had earned my Master's degree in Information Technology Management. So, deciding to leave behind 20 years of accomplishments and start over was incredibly challenging. I had the chance to attend my cousin's graduation ceremony, where I listened to the MD governor's speech—he repeated these words several times:
>**_CHOOSE TOUGH!_**
>
>Wes Moore

- These days, I'm learning Python with a friend in Iran, and here's a simple exercise to practice what I've learned:

```r
a=int(input())
if a>999:
    print('The number must be less than 1000')
else:
    b=(str(a%10)+str((a//10)%10)+str(a//100))
    print(2*int(b))
```
