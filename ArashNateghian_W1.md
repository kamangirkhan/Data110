# Introduction

Over two years have passed since I lost my beloved wife. We were meant to share this journey together, side by side. The day she learned that we had won the lottery, she was very excited—she had always dreamed of leaving Iran, and what better destination than America? Leaving Iran, along with my family and friends, was incredibly difficult, but under the circumstances, it was the best decision I could have made.

As a newcomer, there were several essentials needed to start a new life:
- SSID
- Phone Number
- Bank Account
- Driving License

# First Steps
Once I had secured these, the next phase began: **Building a new Life**
1. Find a Job
2. Enroll in College
3. Purchase a Car
4. Establish Credit
5. Find a Place to Live

# Motivation
I had an *excellent* job possession and had earned my Master's degree in Information Technology Management. So, deciding to leave behind 20 years of accomplishments and start over was incredibly challenging. I had the chance to attend my cousin's graduation ceremony, where I listened to the MD governor's speech—he repeated these words several times:
>**_CHOOSE TOUGH!_**
>
>Wes Moore

# More
- These days, I'm learning Python with a friend in Iran, and here's a simple exercise to practice what I've learned:

```r
a=int(input())
if a>999:
    print('The number must be less than 1000')
else:
    b=(str(a%10)+str((a//10)%10)+str(a//100))
    print(2*int(b))
```
