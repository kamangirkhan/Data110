        "During this activity, I learned how to use Python to work with lists, loops, random number generation, and file handling. I practiced splitting user input into lists, combining elements using loops, and writing output to a file. I also gained a better understanding of how functions like split(), random.sample(), and file operations using the with open() statement work together to make programs more efficient and organized. These exercises helped me see how even simple coding structures can be combined to perform meaningful tasks such as generating random data and saving results automatically.\n",

        "\n",
        "One of the challenges I encountered was managing user input properly—especially removing extra spaces after commas and making sure the program handled names correctly. At first, I also struggled with ensuring that the random numbers were unique and written correctly to the file, but learning about random.sample() solved that problem since it automatically avoids duplicates. I also had to pay attention to indentation and syntax, which are critical in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Anything else you would like to mention?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An enhancement I made was improving the code readability and reliability. For example, I used .strip() to clean up spaces in user inputs and f-strings to format text more clearly. In the random number program, I added sorting in descending order and wrote each number on a new line for better file organization. These small enhancements made the code cleaner, more accurate, and easier to understand.\n",

        "**What enhancement(s) did you make?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this exercise strengthened my confidence in writing Python programs that take user input, process data logically, and store results efficiently. It also reminded me of the importance of debugging, testing, and continuously improving code to make it more user-friendly and reliable."
